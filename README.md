# Healthcare Predictive Analytics: Oral Cancer Detection

## Overview

The **Healthcare Predictive Analytics** project harnesses AI and machine learning to enhance early **oral cancer** detection, aiming to improve patient outcomes and support more efficient healthcare delivery. By developing predictive models, this system provides healthcare professionals with data-driven tools to identify high-risk individuals, detect early warning signs, and enable timely medical intervention.

### Key Features
**AI-Powered Early Detection:** Machine learning models analyze clinical and patient data to detect oral cancer in its early stages.  
**Data-Driven Insights:** Uncovers patterns and trends in oral health metrics, aiding in evidence-based medical decisions.  
**Optimized Resource Management:** Supports better allocation of healthcare resources based on predictive needs.  
**Scalable Deployment:** Designed with MLOps best practices to support continuous model improvement and cloud-based deployment.

### Project Scope
**Includes:**  
- AI model development for **oral cancer detection**.  
- Data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering focused on oral health data.  
- Machine learning model training, evaluation, and optimization.  
- API deployment using Flask/FastAPI for easy integration into healthcare systems.

**Excludes:**  
- Real-time monitoring using IoT/wearable devices.  
- Detection or diagnosis of diseases other than oral cancer.

### Technologies Used
- **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Analysis & Preprocessing)  
- **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch** (Machine Learning)  
- **Flask/FastAPI** (Model Deployment)  
- **MLOps Tools: MLflow/Kubeflow** (Model Tracking & Monitoring)  
- **Power BI** (Interactive Data Visualization)
